Welcome to my Cloud Architecture Learning Portfolio 🚀  

This repository documents my 4-5-months intensive journey to becoming a Cloud Architect with DevOps (Terraform).  
It contains my projects, notes, and hands-on practice as I progress through cloud fundamentals, AWS services, Terraform automation, and CI/CD workflows.

## 📌 Goals
- Build a solid foundation in AWS Cloud Architecture.
- Master Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).
- Design and deploy scalable, secure, and cost-optimized architectures.
- Document projects to showcase skills for future opportunities.
